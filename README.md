# Web Development Showcase

## Overview

The Web Development Showcase is a static website that demonstrates three key web technologies: HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. It provides examples and templates for each technology, allowing users to explore and learn about different aspects of web development.

## Features

- Responsive design using Bootstrap
- Showcase of HTML templates
- Examples of Bootstrap components and layouts
- CSS-based designs and animations
- Easy navigation between different sections

## Getting Started
